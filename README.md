# Books-scraped-data
I scraped a book's website from where I extracted the title, price, rating, and availability of the book.
Then, the scraped data was stored in a CSV and Excel file. Moreover, the program would pause for 30 seconds and then scrape
the data again if any changes occurred on the website.
Note: This was a practice project.
